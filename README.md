# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## To run locally

```
npm install
```

```
npm start
```

## To deploy
Using [react-gh-pages](https://github.com/gitname/react-gh-pages) 

1. With new changes, run:
```
npm run deploy
```

or use (to add custom commit message)

```
npm run deploy -- -m "Deploy React app to GitHub Pages"
```

This will automatically deploy and use the gh-pages branch as the deployed branch.
